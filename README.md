This is a Python script that performs daily temperature prediction using linear regression. The temperature data is loaded from a csv file into a Pandas dataframe and the temperature columns (minimum, average, and maximum) are extracted and prepared for modeling. The data is then split into training and test sets, and a linear regression model is trained on the training data. The model is then used to predict the average temperature for the next 30 days of data. Finally, the actual and predicted temperatures are plotted using the Matplotlib library, and the plot is displayed.
